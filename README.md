# NCAA-Draft-Prediction-Models

A implementation of Decision Tree Cart using SKLearn to predict if an NCAA player will be drafted into the NBA.

The model takes in a text file of comma seperated values corresponding to an NCAA players stats for a given year. As well as their corresponding label (drafted/undrafted).

The model will print correctly and incorrectly classified points, display cross validation accuracy, and generate a tree diagram for each iteration of training.
